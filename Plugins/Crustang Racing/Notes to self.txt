Notes to self:
Move summary is handled in plugin for Gen 3 Contests, in Summary.rb


Alright, organizing my thoughts for AI:


To do:
have AI avoid rocky patches when possible
make AI bad at avoiding it or maybe not try to avoid (maybe with RNG rolls?), but they should still try to avoid them so it simulates wandering up and down

Bugs:


After events (polish):
Add animation to overloading a racer
Make shiny crustang opponents/rentables possible and make the overworld reflect shininess
Make the game end after a certain number of laps or minutes
Make summary in the crustang selection screen possible
Make animation for overload
