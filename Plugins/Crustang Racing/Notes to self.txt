Notes to self:
Move summary is handled in plugin for Gen 3 Contests, in Summary.rb


Alright, organizing my thoughts for AI:


To do:
throttle use of all AI moves with RNG
Put in rocky patches and have AI avoid it when possible

Bugs:


After events (polish):
Add part of the track that slow you down, and make AI bad at avoiding it or maybe not try to avoid (maybe with RNG rolls?)
Add animation to overloading a racer
Make shiny crustang opponents/rentables possible and make the overworld reflect shininess
Make the game end after a certain number of laps or minutes
Make summary in the crustang selection screen possible
