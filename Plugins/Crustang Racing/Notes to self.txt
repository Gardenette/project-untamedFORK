Notes to self:
Only one type of hazard per person - player only gets 1 rock hazard and 1 mud hazard on the track at a time. When spawning another one, the previous one disappears if it is still on the track
This is the same for AI racers

Move summary is handled in plugin for Gen 3 Contests, in Summary.rb
