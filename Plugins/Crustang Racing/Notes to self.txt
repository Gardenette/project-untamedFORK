Notes to self:
Move summary is handled in plugin for Gen 3 Contests, in Summary.rb


Alright, organizing my thoughts for AI:


To do:
Put in rocky patches and have AI avoid it when possible
make AI bad at avoiding it or maybe not try to avoid (maybe with RNG rolls?)
patches are put in random spots on the track at least X amount of pixels apart
they slow you down if you're touching them
make the rock patch set your current speed so you slow down immediately

Bugs:


After events (polish):
Add animation to overloading a racer
Make shiny crustang opponents/rentables possible and make the overworld reflect shininess
Make the game end after a certain number of laps or minutes
Make summary in the crustang selection screen possible
Make animation for overload
