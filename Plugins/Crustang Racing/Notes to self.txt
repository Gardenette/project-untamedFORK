Notes to self:
Move summary is handled in plugin for Gen 3 Contests, in Summary.rb


Alright, organizing my thoughts for AI:

When to use invincible:
Use if available and there's a hazard coming up or if someone is within range of them and charging their spin out move

When to use secondBoost:
Use if boost cooldown greater than 0 but speed is less than what stabilize would give?

When to strafe:
Do not bother avoiding obstacles if invincible






To do:
throttle use of all AI moves with RNG
add AI for racer2 and racer3


After events (polish):
Add part of the track that slow you down, and make AI bad at avoiding it or maybe not try to avoid (maybe with RNG rolls?)
separate boost length in seconds and stabilize boost length in seconds so stabilize lasts longer
Add animation to overloading a racer
